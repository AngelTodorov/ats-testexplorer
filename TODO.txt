
  - Add link/button "Go to last execution of this test" in order to easily navigate to re-run test

    ======================

    problems in IE (International Exploiter)

     - font size - use smaller fonts
     - tables - overflow must be auto, not scroll
     - border round corners - using .htc ie fix
     - Edit,Delete and other buttons - image is outside the button
     - Test state headers (Total,Passed,Running,Failed) - the text must be transparent
     - Home page - 'Choose database...' content must be centralized


    ======================

    - Compare pass/fail tests

    - Merge messages - when the log message is large its reparated by the stored procedure
    to more messages with the same timestamp. We may check if there are messages with same timestamp,
    log level, machine, thread and to merge it in one. But this can't be done if we want to get 10
    results and the 10th is the first part of the message, we wont know for the others (11,12,...)

    - remember the filter selections in the session:
        - the whole Runs filter. Add a special icon on the filter when there is selection

    - the real time change of the running state

    - running state for:
        - suite
        - scenario
        - test case
        - load queue
        - checkpoint
        Change "false"/"true" state text with images !?


    - Add system info for the monitored machines. Can be done using the folloing code:
        Sigar sigar = new Sigar();
        CpuInfo info = sigar.getCpuInfoList()[0];
        System.out.println( "CPU info:\nVendor: " + info.getVendor() + "\nModel: " + info.getModel()
                            + "\nSpeed: " + info.getMhz() + "Mhz\nNumber of CPUs: " + info.getTotalCores()
                            + "\n\nRAM: " + sigar.getMem().getRam() + " MBs" );

    - Performance/monitoring: install Wicket Inspector

   ======================

   - clean unused Stored Procedures - MSSQL

   - update SanityCheck procedure

   - [2011-04-11] IE: AFter page expired there is no return to the previous page

   - [2011-04-11] Major: after replace with new MessagesPannel classes (2) and
   session expiration in -beta testcase messages are missing. Namely only one row without actual message there.

   - [2011-04-11] Low: Research features for session tracking - IP/user, current page? Useful in tomcat manager to check which sessions are important ones and we should delay restart.
